# MagitekRoutine
All in one combat routine for Rebornbuddy


Trying to get Invuln checks

Currently Removes / Doesn't add Invunlnerable targets to the Enemy List

Current Implementation

Good Because:
1. Doesn't AOE invuln targets
2. Doesn't attempt to multiDoT invuln targets

Bad Because:
1. Continues Routine against target even if it has the invuln buff
